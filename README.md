<h1>Fiegn Client for Spring Boot and Twitter Typeahead </h1>

The following example is a Feign client making an external call to a REST service
through Spring Boot and then allows Auto completion of the returned result set
with Twitter typeahead JS library.

Inspired by twitter.com's autocomplete search functionality, typeahead.js is a flexible 
JavaScript library that provides a strong foundation for building robust typeaheads.
